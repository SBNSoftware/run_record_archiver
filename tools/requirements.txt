# Requirements for comparison tools
# These tools reuse parts of the run_record_archiver application

# Core dependencies
pyyaml>=6.0
requests>=2.26.0
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0  # Required by ucondb for PostgreSQL access

# UconDB client (for UconDB comparison tool)
git+https://github.com/ivmfnal/ucondb.git#egg=ucondb

# Note: The ArtdaqDB comparison tool requires 'conftoolp' from the
# artdaq_database environment. This is a system-level dependency provided
# by the artdaq_database suite and is not available on PyPI. The comparison
# scripts will source the required environment setup before execution.
